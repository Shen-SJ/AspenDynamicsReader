# AspenDynamicsReader
> This is a simple python module for read the time-dependent data from 
> AspenDynamics software.  
> During my research, I dealt with plenty of data pasting from software.
> It is a time consuming step, so I built it for saving my time.

### Requirement
* Have AspenDynamics software
* Inkscape: convert the svg plotfile to emf plotfile. If you don't need it.
  you can comment the code in 'plot_dynamic_results', and 'multiplot_dynamic_results'.
  
### Simple Using Step
